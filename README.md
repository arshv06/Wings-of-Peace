# Wings of Peace - Dystopian Drone Control Game

Welcome to the repository for the Wings of Peace, a retro-futuristic game where the player controls a UAV drone for a totalitarian military regime. Your job is to give commands, decode cryptic mission orders, and make difficult moral decisions that impact the war effort and your personal life.

## Game Concept

- **Genre**: Simulation/Decision-based game
- **Theme**: Inspired by dystopian themes like Orwell's *1984*, where the player takes orders from a totalitarian regime and must execute drone missions.
- **Core Gameplay**: 
  - Decode cryptic messages that come through a fax machine.
  - Choose missile types and launch coordinates.
  - Deal with the moral and strategic consequences of your actions.
  - View daily progress updates through a war newspaper.

## Features
- **Retro-Futuristic UI**: Experience a unique game interface designed to look like old-school military tech from the 1980s.
- **Moral Choices**: Each decision has both personal and war-related consequences.
- **Draggable UI Elements**: Move the Top Secret page around the screen after it prints.
